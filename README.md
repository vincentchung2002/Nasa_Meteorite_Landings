# Nasa_Meteorite_Landings
Overview
This project delves into the intriguing realm of meteorite landings on Earth, leveraging a comprehensive dataset sourced from the NASA Open Data Portal. With approximately 45,000 meticulously documented records, this dataset encompasses a wealth of information, offering insights into the geographic distribution, meteorite types, masses, and associated temporal patterns.

Dataset Details
The dataset comprises the following essential fields:

name: Name of the meteorite.
id: Identifier for the meteorite.
nametype: Indicates whether the name is valid or relict.
recclass: Classification of the meteorite.
mass (g): Mass of the meteorite in grams.
fall: Indicates whether the meteorite was observed falling or found afterward.
year: Year and time of the meteorite landing.
reclat: Latitude coordinate of the landing location.
reclong: Longitude coordinate of the landing location.
GeoLocation: Location description.

Key Findings:

Geographic Distribution: Explore the interactive visualizations to gain insights into the global distribution of meteorite landings.

Meteorite Characteristics: Analyze meteorite masses

Regions with Significant Meteorite Activity: Identify regions with a concentration of "heavy" meteorites and understand the factors influencing such patterns.

Implications for Future Predictions: Consider the potential implications of the findings for predicting and preparing for future meteorite landings.
